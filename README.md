### Student's Tasks

The branch `students-tasks` contains some unsolved pieces of the code. Don't worry that your instructor is supposed to go over all this during class. But as a extra reference, here's what you'll find:

##### Main tests

There are 5 tests that need fixing. You can find them in `tests.py` with comments similar to `# FIXME: Test`. To run those tests you can use some make commands that we've created. For example:

```bash
$ make test_1
$ make test_2
$ make test_3 #... etc
```

There are also two more tasks that show extra info

```bash
$ make test  # Runs ALL the tests
$ make test_summary # Just prints a quick summary of the tests that are failing
```

##### Optional exercises

There are two optional tests that can be run with:

```bash
$ make optional_test_1
$ make optional_test_2
```
